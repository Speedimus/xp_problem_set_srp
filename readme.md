### Problem Set

You have been provided the [legacy code](https://github.com/gSchool/xp_problem_set_srp) for `Item` and `RestaurantBill` in an untested codebase that was shown as the example of a SRP violation.

In pairs, make `RestaurantBill` not violate SRP. Use TDD to drive the support and refactoring of this legacy code.
